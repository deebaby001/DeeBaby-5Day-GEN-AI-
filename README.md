# Agricultural Yield Forcasting: An Investigation of the use of GEN AI to evaluate Geographical Imagery

STATEMENT of PURPOSE

Agricultural Satellite imagery plays a crucial role in achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 2: Zero Hunger. This goal is attained by enabling farmers and researchers to efficiently monitor large agricultural areas. This technology helps optimize crop management, improve yield predictions, and ensure food security on a large multi-regional scale.

USE CASE TOPIC

Agricultural Yield Forecasting

INTENT: The intention of this project is to evaluate the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal #2: Zero Hunger, to utilize satellite imagery and weather data to predict crop yields and optimize food distribution. For the purpose of this project I will evaluate 1 satellite image and use the following Generative AI technique 1. Embeddings & Vector Search/Store  2.  Few Shot Prompting and 3. Image Understanding to evaluate the use of the satellite image. Additionally, a You Tube video will be provided for addition support to this initiative.

For the purpose of this project it must be run within Kaggle.
